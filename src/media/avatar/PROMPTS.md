## Estilo Visual Geral (usar como prefixo em todos os prompts)

```
Cartoon character design, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles inspired art style similar to "Rise of the TMNT" (2018) and "Mutant Mayhem" (2023). Bold thick black outlines (comic book ink style), cel-shaded with multiple shading layers for 3D depth, dynamic and energetic pose. NOT flat design — use visible highlights, mid-tones, and shadows on every surface. Bright saturated colors, expressive eyes with large anime-style shine reflections. Clean vector-quality rendering, white or transparent background, full body character design, front-facing 3/4 view.

## 1. MASCOTE PRINCIPAL (gallo-mascot)

```
A young anthropomorphic turtle character, mascot for a kids coding app. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon art style with thick black outlines and cel-shading.

CHARACTER DESIGN:
- Species: Bipedal cartoon turtle standing upright, confident relaxed pose with one hand on hip and the other raised holding a tech gadget
- Body: Rich green skin (#3DB86A) with lighter green highlights on the forehead and arms (#7EEAA8), darker green shadows on jaw and underarms (#1E7A3A). Muscular but kid-friendly proportions (not bulky, more lean and agile)
- Shell: Dark olive-green turtle shell on back (#3D7A2E to #2B5E1E) with hexagonal plate segments outlined in darker green, subtle top-left highlight shine
- Belly/Plastron: Warm sandy yellow (#E8D48B) segmented with faint horizontal lines and a vertical center line, visible from the front

FACE & EXPRESSION:
- Head: Large round head (bigger than realistic proportion, cartoon style), prominent brow ridge
- Bandana/Mask: Ninja-style bandana wrapped across the eyes with eye holes cut out. The bandana has a LEFT-TO-RIGHT GRADIENT from deep purple (#9333EA) to bright orange (#F97316) — this is the signature fusion of Donatello's purple and Michelangelo's orange. Two trailing tails flutter behind the head on the right side, the top one orange and the bottom one lighter orange
- Eyes: Large expressive white eyes visible through the bandana holes, with dark green irises (#2D6A1E), black pupils, and big anime-style white shine spots. Playful and confident expression
- Eyebrows: Raised and slightly angled (one higher than the other), giving a playful-determined look
- Mouth: Wide open Michelangelo-style grin showing a row of white teeth in a zigzag pattern, with a pink tongue visible. Confident and fun
- Nose: Two small nostril dots
- Cheeks: Small green freckle spots near the cheeks (3 dots on each side)

ACCESSORIES & GEAR (Donatello tech + Michelangelo fun):
- Tech Goggles: Purple-tinted aviator goggles (#7C3AED to #A78BFA) pushed up on the forehead above the bandana. Round lenses with white reflection spots. Small cyan LED dots on the outer edges of the goggles
- Bo-Staff: A purple tech bo-staff (#7C3AED) held diagonally behind the body. It has metallic purple tech rings/bands near each end and a glowing cyan (#22D3EE) energy tip at the top that emits small sparkles
- Wrist Device: A small purple wrist-mounted computer/screen on the raised arm, showing green terminal text "> fd 100" and "OK_" in monospace font — this is a Logo programming command
- Wrist Wraps: Sandy/beige cloth wraps (#D4B96A) around both wrists in ninja style
- Knee Pads: Dark green knee pads on both legs
- Toe Wraps: Beige cloth wraps around the feet/toes

ENVIRONMENT/EFFECTS:
- Small floating code text fragments around the character: "repeat 4" and "[fd :n rt 90]" in purple and cyan, slightly rotated
- A colorful turtle trail path behind/below the character (purple to orange gradient line)
- Cyan energy sparkles near the staff tip
- Orange action speed lines near the raised hand
- Clean white or very light background

MOOD: Playful genius — the energy of Michelangelo's "party dude" personality combined with Donatello's tech-savvy intelligence. A turtle that makes coding look cool and fun.

## 2. EXPLORADOR — Faixa 6-8 anos (gallo-explorer)

```
A young anthropomorphic turtle character designed for ages 6-8, mascot variant for a kids coding app. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon art style mixed with kawaii/cute proportions. Thick black outlines, cel-shaded, energetic and adorable.

SAME BASE CHARACTER as the main mascot turtle, but with these KEY DIFFERENCES:

PROPORTIONS: Chubbier, rounder, more baby-like proportions. Bigger head relative to body. Shorter limbs. Overall more "cute" and less "cool."

BANDANA: Predominantly ORANGE (#F97316) fading to purple at the right edge — Michelangelo-dominant because younger kids respond more to the fun/silly energy. Bandana tails flutter playfully behind.

EYES: MUCH BIGGER than the main mascot — kawaii/anime huge eyes with extra sparkle reflections (3 white shine spots per eye instead of 2). Wide open with wonder and excitement. The overall eye size takes up about 40% of the face.

EXPRESSION: Enormous excited open-mouth smile, even bigger than the main mascot. Tongue sticking out slightly. Happy raised eyebrows. Pure joy and wonder.

POSE: One hand waving excitedly in the air (hello!), the other hand raised high holding a MAGIC TECH WAND — a purple staff with tech circuit rings and a big glowing golden star on top that emits colorful sparkles (cyan, orange, purple).

ACCESSORIES:
- No goggles (too complex for this age), replaced with the wand as the main prop
- Same wrist wraps but simpler
- Rounder, softer shell plates (circles instead of hexagons)

ENVIRONMENT:
- Golden glowing stars scattered around the character
- A rainbow trail (6 colors) flowing behind/below
- Colorful sparkles emanating from the magic wand
- Hearts and stars floating in the background
- Warm, magical, inviting atmosphere

MOOD: Pure wonder and excitement. Like a little kid who just discovered something magical. "Coding is MAGIC!" energy. Think Michelangelo at age 7.

## 3. AVENTUREIRO — Faixa 8-12 anos (gallo-adventurer)

```
A young anthropomorphic turtle character designed for ages 8-12, mascot variant for a kids coding app. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon art style — dynamic, confident, cool. Thick black outlines, cel-shading, action pose.

SAME BASE CHARACTER as the main mascot turtle, but with these KEY DIFFERENCES:

PROPORTIONS: Standard cartoon proportions — not as cute as the Explorer, not as edgy as the Hacker. Athletic and agile.

BANDANA: Balanced PURPLE-TO-ORANGE gradient through a magenta/pink middle (#A855F7 → #D946EF → #F97316) — equal parts Donatello and Michelangelo. Bandana tails swept back by wind with extra motion trails.

EXPRESSION: Confident sideways smirk with one eyebrow raised higher than the other (cocky but friendly). Teeth showing with one prominent fang poking out on the side. "I got this" energy.

POSE: Standing on a moving SKATEBOARD, body tilted slightly for dynamic balance. One hand relaxed at the side, the other raised doing a SHAKA/HANG LOOSE hand gesture (pinky and thumb extended). The whole body is tilted ~5 degrees suggesting motion.

SKATEBOARD: A cool skateboard with a purple-to-orange gradient deck (#7C3AED → #F97316), silver metal trucks, white wheels with visible axles, and a golden lightning bolt graphic on the deck underside.

ACCESSORIES:
- Tech Goggles on forehead (same purple style as main mascot)
- Same ninja wrist wraps and knee pads
- Speed lines on the left side suggesting fast movement

ENVIRONMENT:
- Speed/motion lines streaming from left to right
- Wind-swept bandana tails with extra trailing motion blur
- Small energy star bursts near the raised hand
- Dynamic geometric shapes (diamonds) in the background
- Purple and orange color accents throughout

MOOD: Cool confidence and adventure. The kid who's good at everything and knows it, but in an endearing way. "Watch what I can do!" energy. Skateboard + coding = ultimate coolness.

## 4. HACKER — Faixa 10-14 anos (gallo-hacker)

```
A young anthropomorphic turtle character designed for ages 10-14, mascot variant for a kids coding app. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon art style — darker, more intense, tech-focused. Thick black outlines, cel-shading with moodier tones.

SAME BASE CHARACTER as the main mascot turtle, but with these KEY DIFFERENCES:

SKIN TONE: Slightly darker, cooler green (#2EA85A instead of #3DB86A). Less saturated, more serious.

BANDANA: Predominantly DEEP PURPLE (#7C3AED → #9333EA) with only the far right edge fading to orange — Donatello-dominant because older kids respond to the tech/genius energy. Bandana tails are sharper and more angular.

EYES: Narrower, more focused and intense than the other variants. Same white eyes with green irises, but with a subtle CYAN GLOW ring around the iris (#22D3EE). Determined flat eyebrows angled inward. "I'm solving this" focus.

EXPRESSION: Subtle confident smirk (smaller mouth than other variants). Teeth showing but less exaggerated. Cool and controlled rather than excitable.

CLOTHING: Wearing a DARK HOODIE over the shell:
- Dark charcoal gray hoodie (#1F2937 to #111827) with the hood pulled UP, framing the face dramatically
- Hoodie has a kangaroo pocket, a dashed zipper line down the center, and fabric drawstrings
- The shell is mostly hidden but slightly visible through the hoodie opening
- The belly/plastron shows through with faint terminal text printed on it: "> gallogo" and "_ ready" in cyan and green monospace
- Hoodie sleeves cover the arms, with green turtle hands poking out at the wrists

GOGGLES: Purple tech goggles pushed up on the forehead UNDER the hood. Small cyan LED indicator dots glowing on the goggle frames.

POSE: Standing straight with hands at sides (emerging from hoodie sleeves). Calm, collected, slightly mysterious.

ENVIRONMENT:
- TWO FLOATING HOLOGRAPHIC TERMINAL SCREENS flanking the character:
  - Left screen: Dark terminal window (#0F172A) with colored window dots (red/yellow/green), showing Logo code in green and cyan monospace text: "to espiral :n", "  fd :n rt 20", "  espiral :n*0.9", "end" — with a blinking cyan cursor
  - Right screen (smaller, angled): Shows a spiral drawing visualization made of cyan lines
- Subtle matrix-style falling code text in the background (binary numbers and Logo commands like "fd", "rt", "repeat", "make") in very faint cyan
- Circuit board trace lines with small glowing endpoint dots in the corners
- Dark atmospheric mood — this character works at night

MOOD: Quiet genius intensity. The hacker who stays up late solving elegant problems. Donatello's focus and intelligence, with just a hint of Michelangelo's smirk. "I write code that writes code" energy.

## 5. ÍCONE (gallo-icon)

```
A simplified head-only version of the main GalloGo turtle mascot, designed to work as an app icon, favicon, or avatar at sizes as small as 32x32 pixels. TMNT cartoon style with thick outlines.

Circular composition — green turtle head centered inside a soft green circle background (#F0FDF4) with a green border (#2A8F4E).

Shows ONLY: the turtle's head with the purple-to-orange gradient bandana, big expressive eyes through the bandana holes, the wide Mikey grin with zigzag teeth, purple tech goggles pushed up on the forehead, and the top of the dark green shell peeking behind the head at the bottom.

Bold thick outlines on everything. Clean, readable at small sizes. No extra elements or text.
```

## 6. LOGO HORIZONTAL (gallo-logo)

```
Horizontal logo composition: the GalloGo turtle mascot head on the LEFT side, with the text "GalloGo" to the RIGHT.

LEFT ELEMENT: Same simplified head as the icon — green turtle face with purple-to-orange bandana, big eyes, Mikey grin, purple goggles on forehead, shell behind.

RIGHT ELEMENT: The word "GalloGo" in bold rounded sans-serif font (similar to Nunito Black/Poppins ExtraBold):
- "Gallo" in dark forest green (#1E7A3A) with subtle dark outline
- "Go" in a purple-to-orange gradient (#9333EA → #F97316) with dark outline
- A blinking orange cursor line after the text
- Below: the subtitle "APRENDA A PROGRAMAR" in small monospace/tech font, gray color, wide letter-spacing

A thin horizontal accent line runs below everything, with a purple dot on the left end and an orange dot on the right end.

White or transparent background. Clean branding, professional but playful.
